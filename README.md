# Future Marine Fuels
## A Danish Case Study on Climate Compatible Energy Pathways

The research project's main objective is to minimize total system costs for supplying all Danish cargo shipping transport demand while meeting emission reduction target and budget. It investigates possible future energy pathways until 2050 towards carbon neutral Danish shipping in line with the Paris agreement. We consider the following technical and fuel alternatives to the most commonly used internal combustion engines (IC) that burn heavy fuel (HFO) or marine diesel oil (MDO): Bio-diesel (BDO), liquefied bio-methane (LBG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), methane (CH4), methanol (CH3OH), hydrogen (H2), ammonia (NH3) and batteries/wind (BATW).

The problem is translated into a stock model that comprises relevant characteristics of todayâ€™s Danish cargo fleet, its emissions, transport work and fuel consumption. It has different alternative technology investment options as well as emission transport constraints.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

1. Create an environment with Anaconda from the .yml file.
2. 
```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
